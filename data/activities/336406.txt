Escape for a weekend to Stratton, renowned for pristine snow, varied terrain, and excellent grooming. Your weekend on the mountain includes 2 full-day lift tickets, a 2-night stay at a full-service resort, and is complete with access to a world-class recreation center with gym, pool, and sauna.
Kick back and relax in a comfortable coach as you are transported from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to scenic Stratton, Vermont, often referred to as the “Vail of the East.” Once you arrive on Friday evening you feast on a hearty dinner. Then turn in for a good night’s sleep, as Saturday and Sunday are reserved for skiing or snowboarding. Sunday Morning, drop your bags off at the coach before hitting the slopes for your second day of skiing down paths of varying difficulty.
Or, if you are looking for a break from skiing or snowboarding, exchange your ticket and go snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, snow-tubing, or just hit up Stratton Resort’s world-class recreation center complete with gym, pool, and sauna. If you're a beginner you have the option of exchanging your 2 lift tickets for group lessons and rentals.
