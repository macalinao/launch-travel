As the curtain comes up on the African savannah, you’re taken on an enthralling African adventure into the heart of Disney’s classic tale—The Lion King. Journey with Simba as he realizes his royal destiny, all to a soundtrack of Grammy and Academy Award®-winning songs by Elton John and Tim Rice.
The Lion King opens with the instantly recognizable call of Rafiki, and a cast of African animals—brought to life by over 50 actors and dancers—is revealed during a rendition of “The Circle of Life” like you’ve never seen it before. The Pride Lands burst with vividly colored animals—human-powered puppets that journey through the aisles, giving you an up-close look at their fantastically intricate costumes.
Follow the heart-pounding scenes as Simba faces his evil uncle, Scar, is chased from his homeland, and encounters 2 entertaining characters—Timon and Pumbaa—who give him some easy-going insight into their laidback philosophy during “Hakuna Matata.” Having racked up the ultimate in theatrical awards with the Tony for Best Musical, Best Choreography, Best Costume Design, and Best Scenic Design, this is one unbelievable Broadway experience you don’t want to miss.
