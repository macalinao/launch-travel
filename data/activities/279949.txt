Visit key sites around the World Trade Center with a local guide, learning about the human tragedy of 9/11 and the heroics of local firefighters. Visit St. Paul's Chapel, the Reflection Pools, and more. Then finish on a high at the One World Observatory for incredible views over New York City.
The National September 11 Memorial is arguably the most important memorial built since the attacks in 2001. At the twin Reflecting Pools, learn how staff leave a rose in the name of each victim on their birthday, while the Survivor's Tree and Fireman's Memorial bring you uplifting tales of heroism, survival, and even incredible recovery.
Travel in a small group of 20 people or fewer with pre-reserved tickets, so your visit is stress free, while your local guide provides an especially personable experience. Your One World Observatory tour is an independent visit that comes at the end of a 2-hour tour. During the rest of your time you're accompanied by an expert guide. Together, tour the most important sites, including the personal tributes at St. Paul's Chapel, the AmEx Eleven Tears Memorial, the Winter Garden located at the former World Financial Center, and the National September 11 Memorial.
Newly opened to the public, One World Observatory is tipped to be New York City's most popular attraction in 2015. Take the hassle out of your visit with pre-reserved tickets, saving you time waiting in line. Board one of the tower's famous Skypods for the 43-second journey to the top, during which time you can watch New York's skyline change from the 1600s to modern day. Disembark at the 102nd floor for stunning 360-degree views over the city.
