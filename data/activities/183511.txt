Immerse yourself in 5,000 years of world history through the vast collections at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Home to incredible historical artifacts and art, from Egyptian temples to Old Masters paintings, The Met is one of the largest—and finest—museums in the world.
With roots dating back to 1866, admire the Beaux-Arts Fifth Avenue façade and Great Hall before grabbing a map to plot out your day. In the Egyptian gallery, take in the immense Sphinx of Hatshepsut—weighing in at 7 tons (6 t)—with the body of a lion and a human head. Then view the remarkable hieroglyphs carved into the walls of the ancient Temple of Dendur—built in 15 B.C.
Make your way to the American collection to marvel at the epic Washington Crossing the Delaware by Leutze depicting Washington's attack at Trenton on December 25, 1776 before taking a closer look at the magnificent brush strokes of Van Gogh's Wheat Field with Cypresses, found in the extensive European gallery.
Your ticket to the Met comes with the added benefit of same-week admission to The Cloisters Museum, where you can spend time exploring its treasures from medieval Europe, or simply go for a leisurely stroll through the museum's beautiful gardens.
Beginning mid-March 2016 admission to the new Met Breuer is available. This museum location expands the Metropolitan Museum of Art's modern and contemporary art program with series of exhibitions, performances, artist commissions, residencies, and educational initiatives. Get to explore the art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from around the word.
