Based on Alison Bechdel's best-selling graphic memoir, Fun Home is a groundbreaking, 5-time Tony-winning musical that follows the changing relationship between a young lesbian and her gay father. Inventive and emotional, Fun Home challenges our notions about identity, family, and how we see our parents as we grow up.
Settle into your seat as the curtain comes up on a middle-aged Alison, penning her memoir after the unexpected death of her father. While looking back on her life, she reflects on 2 particularly formative times—the impressionable age of 10, as she struggles with her own identity and sexuality, and her first year of college, when she comes out as a lesbian.
The story is a series of flashbacks between these pivotal life moments and the present, carried along by joyful, sensitive, and harmonic tunes that highlight the anger, comedy, and uncomfortable challenges faced by Alison as she looks back and tries to answer the questions: Who am I? And who, really, are my parents?
Lisa Kron and Jeanine Testori rise to the challenge of producing the first mainstream Broadway musical about a lesbian with love, levity, and honest sorrow. With Tony Awards for Best Score and Best Direction and a Grammy nomination for its innovative score, Fun Home is a spirited and deeply touching coming-out and coming-of-age tale that’s not to be missed.
