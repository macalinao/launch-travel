Spend the day savoring the rich, varied collection of The Museum of Modern Art. What sprung from an initial gift of 8 prints and 1 drawing, MoMA’s expansive selection now showcases more than 150,000 contemporary and modern paintings, sculptures, photographs, and prints.
Bypass the line and enter into the masterfully designed, high-ceiling museum space, and head into the true heart of the MoMA—the 4-story Marron Atrium—offering stellar views of the well-loved sculpture garden.
Make your way to examine the swirling blue sky of Vincent van Gogh’s Starry Night. Next, Salvador Dali’s melting collection of clocks in The Persistence of Memory promises to pull you in, while the creativity behind Warhol’s famed Campbell’s Soup Cans is certain to inspire any museumgoer.
Stroll the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden to admire examples of modern sculpture like Picasso’s Monument, a striking steel piece meant to memorialize poet Guillaume Apollinaire. An informative audio program can accompany your journey through the collection, allowing you to listen to the commentary and criticisms by dozens of curators and artists alike.
