Step into the historic New Amsterdam Theater for an in-depth look at the venue that became a Broadway legend. See the impressive stage, visit the Props Studio, and hear what life is like behind the curtains on a hands-on tour for lovers of music and theater.
Your tour begins with some context from a team of guides with first-hand theater experience, from actors to front-of-house managers. Get a look at some of the best sites on Broadway and hear the history behind each place: the unlikely origins of Times Square, the legendary Ziegfeld Follies, and scandals and secrets that you'll hardly believe (like the time a goat fell from the roof of one theater). Learn what goes on backstage on Broadway, from famous romances to long-held superstitions.
Your last stop is the highlight of your experience, a special tour of the New Amsterdam Theatre. Join the theater's in-house historian, visit the first-floor areas and balcony for the best views of the stage, and then enjoy a hands-on visit to the Props Studio, where you can see (and try on) props and costumes from Broadway classics like Aladdin, The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.
