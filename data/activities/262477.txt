Cruise down wide lanes, past manicured gardens, and by calm ponds as you explore Central Park from the comfort of a pedicab. Home to 25,000 trees, 36 bridges and arches, and welcoming nearly 40 million visitors each year, this famous blanket of green in the heart of Manhattan has plenty to see.
Climb into the comfortable bench-style seating behind your experienced local guide as you're driven into the middle of Central Park. Coast alongside well-known water features like the Lake, Harlem Meer, and the expansive Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy Reservoir, where you can catch glimpses of the city skyline reflected in the water’s mirror-smooth reflection. Take a break on a cast-iron bench nestled under the shade of an old hickory tree, or in the grass of one of Central Park’s wide-open spaces, like the Sheep Meadow or the Great Lawn.
Continue on and learn about treasured traditions at park sites like the Wollman Rink—where families gather to ice-skate in the winter—and the Dairy, which once housed cows that supplied milk to residents in the early 20th century.
Stop to smell the roses at the Conservatory Gardens or try to uncover a few of the park’s 29 ornate sculptures and statues, from the gilded Sherman Monument to the solemn bronze figures of the 107th Infantry Memorial. Finish with a final roll by romantic rowboaters in the Pond or active joggers huffing around the park's vast network of paths, open meadows, and shady woodlands.
