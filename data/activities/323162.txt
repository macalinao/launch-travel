Head out of the city and into the winter wonderland of the Northern Catskills for a day on the slopes of Hunter Mountain. Specifically designed with beginner skiers and snowboarders in mind, this is the perfect outing to hone your skills, enjoy the snow, and cozy up in the lodge with a cup of cocoa.
Meet up with your guide in Midtown and settle in for a comfortable and scenic drive out of the city toward Hunter Mountain. Once you arrive, get fitted for your rental gear, letting professionals size you for skis or a snowboard and finding boots that are the perfect fit. Zip up your coat, pull on your gloves, and hit the slopes with an instructor and a small group for a beginner lesson on getting down the hill.
After the lesson, the day is yours to keep perfecting your skills, riding the lift up to the top of the beginner area of the hill and working on turns, carving, and picking up speed. With high-efficiency snow-making machines spread out over all 240 acres (97 ha) of the mountain, even if you fall, you're sure to land in fresh powder.
After 4 PM, the lights come up on the slopes, so you can experience the unique thrills of night skiing. If you want to take a break and warm up, head down to the lodge for a toasty beverage or to scope out the lively music and bar scene of the resort town before your evening ride back to Manhattan.
