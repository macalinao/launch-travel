Sip your way through New York’s craft beer scene on this expert-led tour of the best brews from Midtown to Brooklyn. Raise a toast in a beer garden in Queens, sample Belgian brews in a Williamsburg speakeasy, and whet your whistle on a Manhattan rooftop on this beer-centric excursion.
Meet your guide at Birreria, the cool rooftop brewery on top of Eataly in the Flatiron District. Kick off your drinking adventure with a tasting of authentic cask ales while looking out over Madison Square Park. From there, hop on a comfortable bus and make your way toward Brooklyn. This hipster haven is a hotbed of micro-breweries, and you can get a glimpse of its beer-making past with a stop to check out the remnants of the old Brewers’ Row.
Grab a seat at the Brooklyn Brewery and enjoy a cold pint as your guide shares colorful stories from the lager-producer’s past. Head to Spuyten Duyvil, a tucked-away speakeasy in trendy Williamsburg, for a sampling of rare craft beers from around the globe paired with artisan meats and cheeses.
Soak up some of the suds with a freshly baked pretzel, and then continue on to your final stop—Bohemian Hall in Astoria, Queens. This jovial beer garden was established more than a century ago, and is the perfect place to down some tasty Czech beer and snacks in a friendly, tree-shaded outdoor area or a cozy nook of the inviting bar before your ride back to Manhattan.
