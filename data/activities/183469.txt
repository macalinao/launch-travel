Choose between a full-island tour or shorter semi-circle tour to experience New York from the water. Admire unobstructed views of the famous skyline and the Statue of Liberty while you learn a bit of history from your lighthearted yet informative guide.
Aboard both cruises, experience the grandeur of Midtown and Downtown Manhattan and marvel at the architectural wonders as you cruise along the Hudson River to the Financial District, South Street Seaport, and the Brooklyn Bridge.
The Full-Island Cruise glides all the way around Manhattan Island, continuing up the East River under the Williamsburg Bridge. Get a clear view of the United Nations and Gracie Mansion, the mayorâ€™s residence, as you head up the East Side toward Yankee Stadium and the George Washington Bridge. Appreciate the beauty of The Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a rebuilt monastery, and Columbia University, the oldest institution of higher learning in New York and fifth-oldest in the US.
