Stroll through halls lined with sculptures, paintings, photographs, drawings, and films as you explore the work of American artists from the last century. With exhibits that highlight pieces from the 20th century up to the present day, the Whitney Museum of American Art offers a stunning collection.
Before you even enter what locals refer to as &quot;The Whitney,&quot; snap a few photos of the exceptional architecture of the building's exterior, designed by Renzo Piano. Head inside and start your exploration with the museum's renowned permanent collection or take a moment to admire one of the special projects on display for a limited-time.
Gaze at the delicate use of color in oil paintings by Theodore Robinson, admire the saturated tones of Edward Hopper, and ponder the themes in sculptures by Russell Barnet Aitken and Peter Agostini. When you're ready for a break, consider stopping in at Untitled, a fine dining restaurant where the food is treated and presented as beautifully as the paintings and sculptures that surround it.
Wrap up your day returning to your favorite pieces, or take advantage of a guided tour that provides an in-depth look at some of the museum's most notable exhibits.
