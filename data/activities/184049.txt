Take a day trip out of the city to soak up the history and architecture of another East Coast metropolis—Washington, D.C. Check out the monuments and memorials of the National Mall, see the White House, and dive into the fascinating exhibits at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.
Meet your bus in midtown Manhattan and climb aboard for the drive south to the nation’s capital. Pass through New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland in air-conditioned comfort before arriving in D.C. Your first stop is at Madame Tussauds, where you can get up close to leaders from George Washington to Barack Obama, snapping selfies in the Presidents Gallery and kicking back in a replica of the Oval Office.
Continue on to Capitol Hill, the heart of the country’s political activity. Make short stops at the Capitol and Senate Buildings, and admire the White House from across the lawn as your guide shares facts and information.
Your journey continues at the National Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian, where you have a full 90 minutes to explore the amazing exhibits of this world-class institution—home to the largest collection of historic aircraft in the world. After that, ride to the National Mall, where you can gaze up at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and pay your respects at the Vietnam and Korean War Memorials.
Your day in D.C. concludes with a narrated drive along the Potomac and by the capital’s major sights before hitting the road to head back to Manhattan.
