Journey back to the days after World War II, a time when the French capital was just learning to love and be light once again. An American in Paris tells the romantic story of a young American soldier meeting a beautiful French girl.
An American in Paris celebrates jazz, ballet, and the power of young love, all set against the backdrop of the City of Light. Meet Lise, a beautiful French girl, and Jerry, an American soldier, as they seek a fresh start in the aftermath of the Liberation.
Following a sold-out engagement at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, this rousing musical brings its verve and pizzazz to the Broadway stage. Be swept away by the music of George Gershwin—he penned the score after falling head over heels for Paris in a 1928 visit—as instantly recognizable songs like &quot;I've Got Rhythm,&quot; &quot;Embraceable You,&quot; “The Man I Love,” &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me&quot;, and of course , “An American in Paris” set the scene.
Ballet imbues the entire show with movement and romance, and stars Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope. They both lend grace and energy to the breathtaking choreography and direction of Christopher Wheeldon. Sets and costumes by 6-time Tony Award®-winner Boby Crowley bring the Paris of yesteryear to life, with the curtain coming up to reveal iconic landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe and Galleries Lafayette. The show's got rhythm, music, and a love story for the ages—who could ask for anything more?
