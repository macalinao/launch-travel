Soar high over the New York’s towering skyscrapers and bustling traffic on this comprehensive helicopter tour. Enjoy bird’s-eye views of all 5 of New York’s boroughs, as well as the iconic Statue of Liberty, and lush Central Park aboard a professionally-piloted helicopter.
Your flight begins in Lower Manhattan with views of the Financial District including architectural gems such as the Woolworth Building and the new 1 World Trade Center. See the light reflecting off of the 2 beautiful pools of the National 9/11 Memorial. Hover over the Hudson River towards Liberty and Ellis Islands for an up-close view of the majestic Statue of Liberty.
As you travel up the Hudson, gaze out of the over-sized windows as you approach Midtown. Your eyes dart around the exquisite buildings glittering in the sun as your guide points out the art-deco masterpieces, such as the Empire State, Chrysler, and Met Life Buildings.
Soar further uptown to see 110-acres (44 hectares)  of Central Park’s greenery, winding paths, and reservoir. You know you have nearly reached the tip of Manhattan island once you fly over Columbia University, founded in 1754, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in New York. Soak in a stunning view of the George Washington Bridge’s dual decks and the infield of Yankee Stadium as you near the South Bronx.
Before your flight comes to a close, make your way back to the heliport by way of the west side of the Hudson River for views of the New Jersey Palisades and Frank Sinatra’s hometown of Hoboken. Touch down in Lower Manhattan with plenty of time to explore the city you toured from the sky.
