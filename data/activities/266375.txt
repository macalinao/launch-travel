Pay your reverent respects to the victims of 9/11 at the National September 11 Memorial Museum. Reflect before the quiet fountains where the Twin Towers once stood, and learn about the heroes, sacrifices, and ongoing impact of the tragic 2001 attacks.
Step into the 9/11 Memorial Museum, where historical exhibits convey the shock, horror, and disbelief felt around the nation—and the world—as the World Trade Center towers fell. Walk through a solemn gallery to see portraits of the nearly 3,000 victims of the attacks of September 11, 2001 and of the bombing on February 26, 1993. Learn about each person as you study photographs, and listen to audio remembrances recorded by family and friends.
In Foundation Hall, gaze at preserved sections of the building’s retaining wall and the stairway known as the “Survivor’s Stairs”, used by hundreds to escape to safety. Dynamic media displays present the day's events, and a recording studio gives you the chance to share your own stories and memories of 9/11.
Outside, in the 9/11 Memorial Plaza, visit two dark reflecting pools—each nearly an acre (0.4 ha) in size—set in the footprints of the Twin Towers. The names of victims are engraved in bronze panels around the pools, and waterfalls cascade peacefully down illuminated walls. It's a powerful and sobering monument to the national tragedy that took place here, and a moving and dignified tribute to the thousands of lives lost.
