If you thought Oz was all yellow brick roads and ruby slippers, think again. This award-winning musical takes place long before Dorothy whirled in on her tornado. Meet the unlikely duo of Glinda the Good and Elphaba—the Wicked Witch of the West—as you learn that there are 2 sides to every story.
While Munchkinland and the Emerald City might look familiar, not all is as it seems in this version of the Wizard’s realm, and Oz is under the spell of one very corrupt government. Enter Glinda—pretty, popular, and ambitious—and smart, feisty Elphaba, whose green skin and penchant for political protest have left her terribly misunderstood.
See the fairy-tale landscape from a different point of view as you follow Elphaba from childhood to college to her eventual role as the Wicked Witch of the West. An unforgettable reimagining of L. Frank Baum’s beloved classic, Wicked delves deep into real questions about what it means to be good, what it means to be evil, and what it means to be friends. Catchy and compelling songs like “Popular” and “Defying Gravity” have helped make Wicked a modern classic, and this bewitching spectacle is sure to draw you under its captivating spell.
