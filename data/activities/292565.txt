Hop on a plane in New York City and fly upstate for a day to take in the majestic splendor and natural beauty of Niagara Falls. Tour the falls from the Canadian and American sides, enjoy lunch overlooking the crashing cascade, and get up-close aboard the Maid of the Mist or in the Scenic Tunnels.
Your upstate adventure begins with convenient pickup at your NYC hotel. Ride to the airport, board your plane, and watch out the window as you leave the urban sprawl of the boroughs behind and fly over the lakes, forests, and farmland north of the city. Touch down and hop on a bus to make your way to this breathtaking natural wonder.
Listen to engaging commentary about the falls themselves, the daredevils who have tackled them, and the geology of the region as you approach the first viewpoint. Watch the rushing whitewater of Horseshoe Falls and Bridal Veil Falls from the American side, and then cross the border to the Canadian side for sweeping panoramas of the tumbling torrent.
Break for a tasty buffet lunch at a restaurant overlooking the falls, and then continue your adventure in the afternoon. In the summer months, ride the classic Maid of the Mist right up to the thundering base of the falls. In the winter, walk through the tunnels and boardwalks of the Journey Behind the Falls attraction to stand on misty observation decks before your return ride to the airport and your flight back to New York.
