Visit the National 9/11 Museum and Memorial and cruise the Hudson River, hopping on and off to explore exciting neighborhoods and landmarks with the New York Water Taxi All-Access Day Pass.
Start your day at Pier 79 in Midtown Manhattan and hop aboard the water taxi. As you cruise down the Hudson with the iconic skyline in full view, snap photos from the open-air top deck or take cover in the air-conditioned, glass-enclosed lower deck. On the way, your guide offers interesting and entertaining facts about the city's history and architecture.
With 5 piers on the water taxi route, you may hop-off to stroll through the heart of the historic, quaint West Village, enjoy the area near Christopher Street, or relax in Brooklyn Bridge Park with a stunning view of the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges. The Battery Park pier is just steps from the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.
Located at footprints of the original Twin Towers, the 9/11 Memorial Museum serves as the primary institution concerned with exploring the implications of the events of September 11, 2001. It documents the impact and continuing significance of 9/11 while paying tribute to those who lost their lives.
Take time to examine the artifacts, including the remnants of structural columns and staircases from the original World Trade Center, and learn more about 9/11 in the historical exhibition, which offers details about the tragic events at the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and on Flight 93.
