Cruise along the Hudson River for dramatic views of the Manhattan skyline before embarking on an all-encompassing tour of famous New York City landmarks. Your exploration by land and sea lets you uncover the towering skyscrapers, gigantic parks, and colorful neighborhoods that make up the Big Apple.
Kick off your sightseeing adventure by boarding a boat headed toward Ellis Island and the triumphant torch of Lady Liberty. Crisscrossing sailboats, yachts, and shipping barges provide the perfect backdrop for memorable photos.
Return to the marina and jump on a comfortable coach bound for the city center. Watch busy stockbrokers jostle alongside bankers as you enter the Financial District and catch glimpses of Wall Street’s humming activity. Nearby, find a moment to reflect at the solemn 9/11 Memorial.
Discover the colorful culture of Chinatown before reaching Madison Square Park for picture-perfect looks at the Empire State Building. In Central Park, enjoy the green meadows and woodlands that offer a welcome respite for those who want to escape downtown's jumble of glass and steel, or ponder at places like Strawberry Fields—a living tribute to the work of John Lennon.
Down the street, gaze at the ornate façades of historic churches—like St. Paul’s Chapel and St. Patrick’s Cathedral—and bask in the bright lights of Rockefeller Center before wrapping up your day in the heart of the city.
