The Book of Mormon has taken the theater world by storm, offering a show that’s irreverently sweet and incredibly smart. Laugh out loud as this award-winning Broadway hit comes to life, combining religious satire with expert choreography and hilarious songs.
Watch the story unfold as 2 Mormon missionaries arrive in a Ugandan village with completely unrealistic expectations. One missionary, Elder Price, is an enthusiastic go-getter with a strong dedication to his faith, while his partner, Elder Cunningham, is a socially awkward but well meaning nerd whose tendency to embroider the truth soon lands him in trouble. A heavy dose of culture shock and a fair amount of comical naiveté create unexpected and uproarious situations that only the creators of South Park could have dreamed up.
Enjoy the Grammy-winning soundtrack as the protagonists bumble through their Latter Day responsibilities, eager to share the Book of Mormon—a text that only one of them has read—with villagers more concerned by the violent whims of a manic local warlord. Songs like Turn It Off and Spooky Mormon Hell Dream offer hilarious insight into the missionaries' own inner turmoil. Follow every awkward moment, religious jab, and carefully crafted pun as the play draws toward a climactic ending you have to see for yourself.
