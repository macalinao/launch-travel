Sprawling over 843 acres (341 ha) in the heart of Manhattan, Central Park is a jewel of emerald green space amid the city's soaring skyscrapers. Pedal along the park's network of trails by bike, scoping out architectural gems and hidden treasures with a professional guide.
The very first landscaped park in the US, Central Park has plenty of history within its bounds and has been the heart of the city for over a century. Meet your city-licensed, professional guide at a bike shop just 2 blocks from the park and get equipped, strapping on your helmet and adjusting the seat on your comfortable Biria bike before setting off.
Pedal around the park at a leisurely pace, stopping to check out iconic Central Park locations along the way. See sites you may recognize from major films and TV shows, like the Bethesda Terrace and Fountain and the Cherry Hill Fountainâ€”originally designed as a watering trough for horses. Ride around the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir as your guide points out celebrity homes in the elegant buildings that line the park.
Cruise up to the Imagine mosaic, a tribute to John Lennon, and see statues of Alice in Wonderland characters overlooking the formal Conservatory Garden. As you pass through the Shakespeare Garden, keep your eyes peeled for plaques with quotes from the bard, and hop off your bike to take in the view from the top of Belvedere Castle. Stop to scope out the souvenirs on offer in the gift shop at the elegant Tavern on the Green before looping back to where your tour began.
