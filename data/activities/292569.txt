Leave the city behind and soak up all the sunny, seaside spectacle of South Beach on this day trip to Miami. Enjoy a quick and easy flight from the Big Apple south, tuck into lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe, and explore the colorful bustle of this vibrant Florida metropolis from atop a double-decker bus.
Kick off your Biscayne Bay adventure with pickup from your New York hotel. Ride to the airport, board your flight, and pass over the entire Eastern Seaboard as you make your way down to Florida’s southernmost tip. After you’re dropped off in the city, you have a full 6 hours to explore at your leisure.
Grab a seat on a double-decker hop-on hop-off sightseeing bus to get a feel for the round-the-clock bustle and energetic vibe of this cosmopolitan city. Listen to commentary as you ride down Ocean Drive, and jump off if you’d like to check out Miracle Mile, Little Havana, or attractions like the Miami Seaquarium.
Break for the lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe to refuel midday and be sure to make your way to the beach to dig your toes into the sand before your return ride to the airport for your early evening flight back to New York.
