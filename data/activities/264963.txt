Stroll along elevated parkland flanked by looming skyscrapers, cruise the steel-grey waters of the Hudson River, and see the Statue of Liberty illuminated against the New York City skyline. When the sun dips below the horizon, watch the Big Apple come to life in lights.
Begin above bustling streets on the overgrown rails of High Line Park, an abandoned section of elevated railroad that has been turned into a relaxing collection of manicured lawns and gardens. After wandering atop this floating strip of green, head to the marina for an evening boat ride during peak season.
Board a spacious vessel and venture out into New York Harbor for up-close looks at Lady Liberty and amazing views of Manhattan. Catch glimpses of the Brooklyn Bridge and its bulb-laden support cables, strung like pearls between imposing towers. For those of age, enjoy a sparkling glass of champagne while you snap photos and gaze at the city.
Return to land for a whirlwind tour of famous landmarks. Explore the fascinating façades of early 19th-century commercial structures at the South Street Seaport. Get postcard-worthy glances of the Empire State Building, Flatiron Building, and Met Life Tower, with a stop at Madison Square Park.
Roll past the warm glow of Grand Central Terminal’s exterior clock and toward the jumble of noise and color in Times Square before wrapping up your evening, surrounded by the glimmering glass and steel high rises of the Financial District.
