Fall under the spell of this classic yet haunting love story as you journey deep beneath the stage of the Paris Opera House with the Phantom and his beloved soprano—Christine. Winner of 7 Tony Awards® including Best Musical, The Phantom of the Opera is Broadway's longest-running show.
At the Paris Opera House, a hideously deformed and masked Phantom lurks beneath the stage. He exercises a reign of terror over the performers at the opera in his quest to turn Christine, the young soprano he loves, into a star. Elaborately costumed actors are illuminated and transport you into a world of intrigue and high drama from the moment the curtain comes up.
Powerful music, stirring vocals, and poetic lyrics move the action along as the Phantom and Christine glide in a boat across a candlelit stage en route to his underground lair. Songs like the achingly beautiful &quot;Think of Me,” the tender “The Music of the Night,” and the powerful titular number “The Phantom of the Opera” are sure to stir your emotions and keep you on the edge of your seat.
With fantastic stage effects, a heartbreaking story line, and the timeless songs of Andrew Lloyd Webber, it's no wonder Phantom has captivated the hearts of millions for more than 25 years.
