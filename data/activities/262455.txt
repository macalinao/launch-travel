Meander along promenades flanked by manicured lawns and beautiful fountains as you enter a world away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. With a knowledgeable guide to lead you, visit the well-known landmarks and hidden oases spread throughout all 883 acres (315 ha) of Central Park.
Begin at the south side of the park and work your way north. Visit the stunning Conservatory Gardens, where carefully organized flower beds showcase Italian, French, and English styles of gardening. Continue on and learn about the park’s history with a stop at the Dairy building—where families once came to get milk from resident cows.
The Lake provides a great place for photos before you cross over the cast-iron Bow Bridge to explore more water features. Walk beside the banks of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and take a break to do some people-watching near the Bethesda Fountain, a popular gathering place for street musicians and performers.
Loop back toward your starting point as your guide reveals filming locations used in hit movies, like the Boathouse Café featured in When Harry Met Sally and the Bandshell, seen in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Finish your day with a final stroll through the Mall, where the heavy branches of American elm trees overhang a wide boulevard, punctuated by iron benches filled with happy visitors.
