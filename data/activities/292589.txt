Hop on the tracks and follow the timeless rail route from the Big Apple to the nation's capitol. Spend a day checking out stunning memorials, grand monuments, and historic neighborhoods of DC as you cruise through the streets on a convenient tour bus and dine on a tasty lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe.
Frequented by politicians and executives throughout the week, the route from New York to Washington, D.C. is a classic. Climb aboard and join the ranks of suited locals as the whistle sounds and you pull away from the station. Roll through small towns that line the coast and pick up a few extra passengers in the City of Brotherly Love and Baltimore before you arrive in DC.
Take the afternoon to explore the city on a hop-on hop-off bus, making convenient stops at the most well-known sites around town. Dive into the nation's past with a visit to the renowned Smithsonian Museum, snap photos of the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorial, pay tribute to lives lost at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and admire the stately columns of the White House, all featured on your tour route.
Before you head back to the City That Never Sleeps, grab a bite to eat from the Hard Rock Cafe, where you can tuck into a juicy burger, savory sandwich, or refreshing salad while listening to classic tunes and rock 'n' roll riffs.
