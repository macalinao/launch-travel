Set sail aboard the Spirit of New York for an evening of delectable food, spectacular skyline views, and lively entertainment. With a tasty cocktail in hand, relax on the open-air top deck or dance the night away as the DJ spins Top 40 hits.
The night begins with a buffet-style candlelit dinner, featuring fresh salads, garlic-encrusted salmon, and vegetarian options like baked pastas. For dessert, indulge in decadent miniature pastries and rich chocolate brownies.
Visit one of several full-service bars for your cocktail of choice, and climb up to the top deck for breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. As the vessel cruises south, bask in the light of the Statue of Liberty’s torch as you point your camera at the ever-changing view. Be sure to spot the towering One World Trade Center and the majestic Empire State Building. Snap as many pictures as you’d like before you head back to the main deck.
It’s time to make your move onto the dance floor as a DJ plays the tracks that get your feet moving. Spend the rest of your night dancing, or simply chill out with a cocktail and chat with your fellow cruisers.
