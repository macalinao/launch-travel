In a city of skyscrapers, it’s no surprise that some of the coolest places to be are on the roofs, where fashionable bars and laidback lounges offer fresh air and sweeping views of the urban landscape. Hit the town with a local guide to sip your way between 3 of New York’s hippest sky-high bars.
Meet your guide in Midtown and get ready for an unforgettable evening out, scoping out the scene on rooftops from Times Square to the Meatpacking District. Stops vary each night, but you might make your way to the Sky Room, where the retractable roof opens up to let the stars in and the terraces boast incredible 360-degree views of Manhattan and the Hudson River.
From there, you might continue to PHD (the Penthouse at Dream), where you can gaze out at the Empire State Building, cocktail in hand, or to Plunge at the Gansevoort, where a DJ spins tunes to set the mood on the wraparound balconies. At 230 FIFTH, cozy up under a heater in the rooftop garden with a drink, or chill amid the sleek décor at Monarch.
A comfortable bus means you can jet between watering holes without worrying about hailing a cab, and your guide covers 3 drinks to make sure you sample the best cocktails on offer at each hot spot. Over a snack, chat with in-the-know locals, the fellow party-lovers in your group, and your fun-loving guide to pick up more tips on must-visit clubs, pubs, and bars around the City that Never Sleeps.
