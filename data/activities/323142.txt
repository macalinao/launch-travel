Leave the city for the slopes with a day trip into the white winter wonderland of the Great Northern Catskills. Explore all the terrain that beautiful Hunter Mountain has to offer as you scope out its 58 runs, 2 terrain parks, and 240 acres (97 ha) of snowy playground.
Head to Midtown and hop on a comfortable bus for the ride north to Hunter Mountain. Once you arrive, get professionally fitted for the gear you need for the day. Expert staff help you pick out perfectly sized boots and skis or a snowboard, selecting equipment suited for your ability level and the kind of terrain you want to explore.
From there, the day is yours to tackle the slopes at your own pace. Snow-makers churn out fresh powder across the entire resort, so even on sunny days you can count on smooth runs. Hunter Mountain caters to skiers and riders of all abilities. Head to one of the 2 terrain parks to practice your jumps and grabs, test your mettle on the expert and advanced runs, or stick to the intermediate and beginner slopes to hone your skills and just enjoy the scenery.
When it's time to warm up, head down to the base to grab a steaming cup of hot chocolate in the lodge, or kick off your boots and relax while checking out the village's vibrant music and bar scene before your return ride to New York.
