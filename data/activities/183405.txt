Bask in the sun and feel the breeze in your hair on board the New York Water Taxi. Take in the entire Manhattan skyline, including the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, and Brooklyn Bridge. At any of the 5 piers you may hop on and off to explore the city at your own pace.
This All-Access Day Pass for a hop-on hop-off cruise gives you license to explore exciting neighborhoods and landmarks near the 5 piers. You may want to explore The Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum near Pier 79 in Midtown Manhattan; walk through the heart of historic and quaint West Village near Christopher Street; take a moment to reflect at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum steps from Battery Park; or stroll through Brooklyn Bridge Park.
From the Brooklyn Bridge pier, take a short walk over to trendy DUMBO neighborhood for some shopping, or have a bite with a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline, as well as the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges.
Aboard the Water Taxi, snap panoramic photos or sit back and relax on the top deck. You can also take cover in the air-conditioned, glass-enclosed lower deck, where you can grab a snack or drink from the onboard cash bar. Guides offer interesting and entertaining facts about city's history and architecture.
