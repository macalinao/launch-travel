Visit 3 of Lower Manhattan's most symbolic sites on this full-day tour. An expert guide offers insightful commentary on the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and the 9/11 Memorial while also leaving you plenty of freedom to explore at your own pace.
Meet your guide at Battery Park, the southernmost tip of Manhattan, and enjoy priority boarding for an early boat across the water to Liberty Island. Gaze up at the Statue of Liberty, and listen as your guide shares the history behind this towering American icon before heading into the statue's pedestal for an even closer look.
Leave Lady Liberty behind and ferry across to Ellis Island to discover what 12 million immigrants experienced as they entered the United States for the first time. Step into the Great Hall, and learn about the so-called Stairs of Separation as you walk down the steps where the fates of so many families changed course. Spend as much time as you like exploring the exhibits, or ferry right back to Battery Park to grab lunch at your leisure before the afternoon portion of your tour.
Reconvene at St. Paul's Chapel, where New Yorkers gathered on September 11, 2001 to await news of loved ones and where volunteer workers rested in the weeks following the attacks. Pass by the Winter Garden and the Eleven Tears Memorial before making your way to the 9/11 Memorial itself.
Gaze down into the deep reflecting pools, where water cascades peacefully in the footprints left by the fallen Twin Towers. Your guide leads you to poignant tributes like the Fireman's Memorial before leaving you to walk through the stirring 9/11 Memorial Museum on your own.
