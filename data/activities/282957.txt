Paint the town on this exclusive evening out, hitting 2 or 3 of New York’s hottest nightclubs with a fun-loving local guide and a like-minded group of fellow party-seekers. Skip the lines and head straight to a VIP table, where you can sip drinks and hit the dance floor well into the wee hours.
Put on your dancing shoes and meet your guide in Midtown to kick off your stylish soiree in the City that Never Sleeps. You might catch a set or 2 from a world-famous DJ at the massive, high-energy nightclub Pacha, or head into the Meatpacking District to sip a cocktail on the plush, chandelier-lit couches of the Griffin.
Head underground to the Gothic-inspired Cellar Bar, rub elbows with jet setters at the exclusive, Parisian-styled VIP Room, or scan the candlelit crowd for celebrities at Avenue. At Lavo, skirt the velvet rope and get down to some of the hottest electronic acts in town, groove in the flashing lights at Marquee in Chelsea, or cool off on the rooftop terrace at Sky Room while you gaze out over the city skyline.
In this nightlife-loving city, the options for night owls are almost endless. Your guide covers your first 3 drinks and the tour is open-ended, so you can keep on partying way past the bewitching hour as you soak up the celebratory scene of New York’s coolest clubs.
