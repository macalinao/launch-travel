Witness the power of Niagara Falls on this 2-day guided tour. See the rushing waters of American and Horseshoe Falls, ride aboard the Maid of the Mist, and score bargains on designer fashions with an outlet mall shopping stop on your way back to Manhattan.
Day 1: New York – Finger Lakes – Niagara Falls
Depart New York City in an air-conditioned bus and head north toward the border. After passing the Delaware Gap’s scenic waterways, make your way to Watkins Glen State Park in the heart of the Finger Lakes region. Stretch your legs with a stroll through Watkins Glen Canyon for breathtaking views of its calm pools and tumbling waterfalls.
Drive by tranquil Seneca Lake to arrive at Niagara Falls by late afternoon—the perfect time of day to catch awe-inspiring views of the American Falls and Goat Island. After the sun sets, catch the colorful light show that illuminates the thundering waters before heading to your hotel.
Day 2: Niagara Falls – New York
After breakfast, venture to impressive Horseshoe Falls. At a towering 170 feet (52 m) tall, this is the largest segment of Niagara Falls. In the summer months, take a seat on the Maid of the Mist for an up-close encounter with the cascading waters. If you’re touring in the winter, grab a raincoat and make your way to dramatic vantage points via the Scenic Tunnels.
Head back toward New York around midday, breaking on the way at a large designer outlet mall to shop for bargains before arriving back in the city.
