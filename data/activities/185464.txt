An evil vizier, a comical genie, and a love story for the ages— Aladdin is everything you loved about the Disney movie and more. With the songs you know by heart plus new tunes penned by Oscar-winning composers, this musical magic carpet ride is infectiously fun and destined to be a classic.
The curtain comes up on the bustle and hubbub of Agrabah, where street-smart commoner Aladdin is keeping “One Jump Ahead” as he navigates the bazaar. Power-hungry Jafar—advisor to the bumbling Sultan—seeks out this harem pant-wearing urchin to steal a golden lamp from the mystical Cave of Wonders.
Things go a bit sideways in the cave, and a razzle dazzle extravaganza of sequined dance numbers, jewel-hued costumes, and enchanting storytelling results. Genie—who spouts off a tongue-twisting rendition of “Friend Like Me” with downright magical aplomb—turns our hero from Aladdin into Prince Ali, helping him woo the beautiful princess Jasmine with a romantic ride on a flying carpet.
Favorite songs by Oscar-winning composers Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice are given new life onstage, and it’s impossible not to be carried away by a score that includes “A Whole New World,” “Arabian Nights,” and “Prince Ali.” Hilarious and heartwarming, colorful and energetic, this rags-to-riches spectacle is an adventure the whole family can enjoy.
