See Manhattan from atop Rockefeller Center, where viewing the New York skyline is as easy as a 360-degree spin. Reaching 850 feet (259 m) into the air, Top of the Rock's 3 unobstructed observation decks are available rain or shine, and the unique timed-ticket entry will save you time in line.
Feel like you're floating directly above Central Park's intricate pathways and reservoir. Architectural wonders like the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building look almost close enough to touch, and you can look all the way to the East River bridges and Statue of Liberty. As you circle around the observation decks, have your camera ready to snap pictures of the stunning urban landscape.
Once you've seen the city from above, explore the rest of Rockefeller Center. Stop at the skating rink, visit the home of the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), or find a treasure in one of the many ground and concourse-level shops and restaurants.
