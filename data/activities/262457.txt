Your tour begins on the Manhattan side of the bridge, at the steps of the historic Tweed Courthouse.

Pop into contemporary art galleries, and follow the sweet perfume of cocoa to Jacques Torres Chocolate, where you can shop for delicious treats or sip a mug of rich hot chocolate if you'd like. Your tour concludes in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where you can take in a final vista over the waterfront and cityscape before continuing your exploration on your own.
