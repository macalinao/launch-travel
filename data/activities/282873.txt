Take in much of the Manhattan skyline from Midtown to Downtown, including the Empire State Building, 1 World Trade Center, and Brooklyn Bridge, along with glimpses of the Statue of Liberty. Throughout the day, you may hop on and off at any of the 4 piers to explore the city at your own pace.
Aboard the cruise, head up to the top deck to snap photos of the magnificent architecture seen along your route. Or perhaps you prefer to relax while soaking up some rays and feeling the wind blow through your hair. The vessel is all-weather, so you can also take cover in the air-conditioned, glass-enclosed lower deck to have a bit to eat or drink from the onboard cash bar.
Explore exciting neighborhoods and landmarks near the 4 piers that you can hop off at. Visit the Hudson River Park or the massive Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum. Take a moment to reflect at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum just steps from World Financial Center pier.
Then, you can stop for a bite to eat in Brooklyn's trendy DUMBO neighborhood and stroll through Brooklyn Bridge Park, offering stunning views of the Manhattan skyline.
