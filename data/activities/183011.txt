Spend a day exploring fascinating artifacts and life-like exhibits like the blue whale and dinosaur skeleton as you wander the halls of this iconic, world-class museum. Delve into the depths of the ocean, walk with the dinosaurs, and venture into outer space during your visit.
A sculpted showdown—cast from real dinosaur fossils—between a Barosaurus and an Allosaurus greets you beneath the soaring ceilings of the museum's rotunda as you enter, setting the scene for the dramatic and lifelike exhibits to come. From here, journey to the African savanna to spy on gorillas, lions, elephants, and giraffes in detailed replicas of their natural habitats.
In the Rose Center for Earth and Space, wind your way up the space-bound Cosmic Pathway, following the history of the universe—from the formation of the Milky Way to the beginnings of life on Earth. Learn about the astrophysical mystery known as &quot;dark energy&quot; and gaze up at galaxies, constellations, and nebulae inside the Hayden Planetarium.
Then head downstairs to the Hall of Ocean Life, immersing yourself in a watery world as you walk beneath a 94-foot (29-m) replica of a blue whale and spend time checking out the vast and wonderful marine life on display, from dolphins and sharks to jellyfish and giant squid.
