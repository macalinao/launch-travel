From the Statue of Liberty, that beacon of freedom that welcomed immigrants into New York Harbor, to Ellis Island, where their fates and futures changed course, this guided tour takes you to Lower Manhattan's historic landmarks and into its storied past.
Meet your local guide in Battery Park. Located at the southernmost tip of the island, this park is often overlooked by visitors headed to the ferries. Spend some time exploring this area's lesser-known monuments and attractions, like the Castle Clinton National Monument, the Pier A Harbor House, the American Merchant Mariner's Memorial, the Sphere, and the New York Korean War Veteran's Memorial.
Step aboard one of the day's first ferries with priority boarding to beat the crowds across the water to Liberty Island. Walk around the base of the statue and learn about the symbolism of Lady Liberty's tablet, the 7 rays of her helmet, and the broken chain at her feet. Gain special access to the statue's pedestal, and hear the history behind the efforts that went into actually erecting the Statue of Liberty in its current location.
Head back to the ferry and take a short ride to Ellis Island. More than 12 million immigrants passed through this space during its time as the nation's busiest immigrant inspection station, from 1892 to 1954. Walk into the red brick building and down the Stairs of Separation. Your guide leads you through the museum's interactive exhibits before leaving you to continue exploring before ferrying back to Manhattan at your leisure.
