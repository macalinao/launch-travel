The Color Purple is an intensely moving musical about a woman who finds the strength to triumph over adversity in order to discover her unique voice in the world. This Broadway show, based on the novel of the same name by Alice Walker, earned 11 Tony Award nominations in 2006.
Set to a jubilant score featuring ragtime, gospel, jazz, and blues, with lyrics by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis, and Stephen Bray, The Color Purple is a tale of hope and perseverance. The story spans 40 years of the life of Celie, an African-American woman in the South who overcomes incredible abuse to follow her dreams.
Now, this American classic comes to Broadway with a powerhouse cast led by Oscar®-, Golden Globe®-, and Grammy®-winner Jennifer Hudson—best known for her role in the film Dreamgirls—as songstress Shrug Avery. Hudson plays alongside celebrated London star Cynthia Erivo, who recreates her electrifying performance as Celie, and Orange is the New Black star Danielle Brooks.
