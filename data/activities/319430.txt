The 9/11 Tribute Center provides a space for survivors, family members, first-responders, civilian volunteers, and community residents to share accounts of 9/11 with the general public. This self-guided tour takes you through galleries on a visceral journey through the events and aftermath of 9/11.
Volunteer curators—including retired firefighters, police officers, and surviving family members—give their personal accounts of the attack. Opt for a volunteer guided tour for additional fee. See artifacts from ground zero up close, juxtaposed with emotional recollections and testimonies from survivors of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Listen as your guide narrates the events and aftermath of the day.
A project of the September 11th Families Association, the 9/11 Tribute Center brings together those who want to learn about 9/11 with those who experienced it. The healing process demonstrated by the 9/11 community in the face of unimaginable horror speaks volumes on the tremendous depth of our humanity.
