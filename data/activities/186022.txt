Take on 2 of New York City's most iconic landmarks, on-foot and afloat. From the sky-high vantage point at the top of the Empire State Building, to a mid-river perspective of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, you have the freedom to soak up both spectacular experiences over a span of 2 memorable days.
Arrive at the Empire State Building, admire the lobby's impressive art deco interiors, and ascend from ground-level to the 86th floor. Absorb this world-famous structure's 360-degree panoramas of the city skyline via its 1,050-foot (320-m) observation deck. Far from the city’s ever-present hustle and bustle, you can peacefully gaze at famed sights such as Central Park, Times Square, and the Financial District.
For a contrast in perspective, head from sky to sea-level as you climb aboard your scenic cruise of the New York Harbor. Soak up the vistas of the sweeping Manhattan skyline—a view captured only from the water—and have your camera ready as you sail towards Lady Liberty herself for an unforgettable, up-close look at this symbol of freedom.
