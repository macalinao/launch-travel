Take a poignant and emotional journey through the award-winning Ground Zero Museum Workshop, reflecting as you view seldom-seen footage, moving images, and somber artifacts from the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.
Join an intimate group of no more than 28 people for a powerful visit, beginning with a historical introduction from your tour guide. After hearing about how the museum was conceived, watch a brief film featuring rare video footage and images from the Recovery Period.
Next, during the walk-thru interactive experience, you will pick up and hold actual artifacts from the World Trade Center, learn their history and examine rare photos from the New York Times that capture the 9-month dig for the missing and heroism all at once. With an audio-guide providing narration for each piece, immerse yourself in the emotions  of September 11th through 100 stunning images taken by Ground Zero’s Official FDNY Photographer, Gary Marlon Suson. On display are the Frozen Clock - the Bible Page - the Today is 11 Calendar Page and more.
After the humbling retrospective, explore the commemorative books and posters available for purchase—a portion of all proceeds benefit FDNY charities. Just steps away from the High Line Park and Chelsea Market eateries.
