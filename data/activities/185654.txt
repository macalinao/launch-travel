Watch as a world of greed, seductive murderesses, and all that jazz unfolds before your eyes during a rousing performance of Chicago. The winner of 6 Tony Awards® and the longest-running musical revival in Broadway history, this razzle-dazzle spectacle is sure to sweep you off your seat.
This classic tale of fame and fortune is set in 1920s Chicago, “where the gin is cold but the piano’s hot.” Tensions run high as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, 2 young and beautiful vaudeville performers, vie for the spotlight and the attention of the adoring public—all from behind bars.
The show opens with a riveting musical introduction by Velma—an infamous stage star locked up for murdering her sister and philandering husband—as she becomes the belle of the prison ball. But her fame quickly fizzles as the media catches wind of Roxie’s equally enticing arrest after the untimely death of her lover. Unsavory characters like corrupt prison matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton and lawyer Billy Flynn add to the drama.
Bright lights, show-stopping songs, and toe-tapping dance numbers take the stage as the 2 starlets duke it out for coveted space on the front page headlines. With Tony Awards® for Best Revival of a Musical and Best Choreography and a Grammy Award for the Best Musical Theater Album, this is one unforgettable journey into Chicago’s sultry, storied past.
