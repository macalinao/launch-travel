But her fame quickly fizzles as the media catches wind of Roxie’s equally enticing arrest after the untimely death of her lover. Unsavory characters like corrupt prison matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton and lawyer Billy Flynn add to the drama.\nBright lights, show-stopping songs, and toe-tapping dance numbers take the stage as the 2 starlets duke it out for coveted space on the front page headlines.

      "descriptionLong": "An evil vizier, a comical genie, and a love story for the ages— Aladdin is everything you loved about the Disney movie and more. With the songs you know by heart plus new tunes penned by Oscar-winning composers, this musical magic carpet ride is infectiously fun and destined to be a classic.\nThe curtain comes up on the bustle and hubbub of Agrabah, where street-smart commoner Aladdin is keeping “One Jump Ahead” as he navigates the bazaar. Power-hungry Jafar—advisor to the bumbling Sultan—seeks out this harem pant-wearing urchin to steal a golden lamp from the mystical Cave of Wonders.\nThings go a bit sideways in the cave, and a razzle dazzle extravaganza of sequined dance numbers, jewel-hued costumes, and enchanting storytelling results. Genie—who spouts off a tongue-twisting rendition of “Friend Like Me” with downright magical aplomb—turns our hero from Aladdin into Prince Ali, helping him woo the beautiful princess Jasmine with a romantic ride on a flying carpet.\nFavorite songs by Oscar-winning composers Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice are given new life onstage, and it’s impossible not to be carried away by a score that includes “A Whole New World,” “Arabian Nights,” and “Prince Ali.” Hilarious and heartwarming, colorful and energetic, this rags-to-riches spectacle is an adventure the whole family can enjoy.",

Laugh out loud as this award-winning Broadway hit comes to life, combining religious satire with expert choreography and hilarious songs.\nWatch the story unfold as 2 Mormon missionaries arrive in a Ugandan village with completely unrealistic expectations. One missionary, Elder Price, is an enthusiastic go-getter with a strong dedication to his faith, while his partner, Elder Cunningham, is a socially awkward but well meaning nerd whose tendency to embroider the truth soon lands him in trouble. A heavy dose of culture shock and a fair amount of comical naiveté create unexpected and uproarious situations that only the creators of South Park could have dreamed up.\nEnjoy the Grammy-winning soundtrack as the protagonists bumble through their Latter Day responsibilities, eager to share the Book of Mormon—a text that only one of them has read—with villagers more concerned by the violent whims of a manic local warlord. Songs like Turn It Off and Spooky Mormon Hell Dream offer hilarious insight into the missionaries' own inner turmoil. Follow every awkward moment, religious jab, and carefully crafted pun as the play draws toward a climactic ending you have to see for yourself.",

While looking back on her life, she reflects on 2 particularly formative times—the impressionable age of 10, as she struggles with her own identity and sexuality, and her first year of college, when she comes out as a lesbian.\nThe story is a series of flashbacks between these pivotal life moments and the present, carried along by joyful, sensitive, and harmonic tunes that highlight the anger, comedy, and uncomfortable challenges faced by Alison as she looks back and tries to answer the questions: Who am I? And who, really, are my parents?\nLisa Kron and Jeanine Testori rise to the challenge of producing the first mainstream Broadway musical about a lesbian with love, levity, and honest sorrow. With Tony Awards for Best Score and Best Direction and a Grammy nomination for its innovative score, Fun Home is a spirited and deeply touching coming-out and coming-of-age tale that’s not to be missed.",
