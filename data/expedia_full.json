The winner of 6 Tony Awards® and the longest-running musical revival in Broadway history, this razzle-dazzle spectacle is sure to sweep you off your seat.\nThis classic tale of fame and fortune is set in 1920s Chicago, “where the gin is cold but the piano’s hot.” Tensions run high as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, 2 young and beautiful vaudeville performers, vie for the spotlight and the attention of the adoring public—all from behind bars.\nThe show opens with a riveting musical introduction by Velma—an infamous stage star locked up for murdering her sister and philandering husband—as she becomes the belle of the prison ball. But her fame quickly fizzles as the media catches wind of Roxie’s equally enticing arrest after the untimely death of her lover. Unsavory characters like corrupt prison matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton and lawyer Billy Flynn add to the drama.\nBright lights, show-stopping songs, and toe-tapping dance numbers take the stage as the 2 starlets duke it out for coveted space on the front page headlines. With Tony Awards® for Best Revival of a Musical and Best Choreography and a Grammy Award for the Best Musical Theater Album, this is one unforgettable journey into Chicago’s sultry, storied past.",

      "descriptionLong": "Visit 3 of Lower Manhattan's most symbolic sites on this full-day tour. An expert guide offers insightful commentary on the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and the 9/11 Memorial while also leaving you plenty of freedom to explore at your own pace.\nMeet your guide at Battery Park, the southernmost tip of Manhattan, and enjoy priority boarding for an early boat across the water to Liberty Island. Gaze up at the Statue of Liberty, and listen as your guide shares the history behind this towering American icon before heading into the statue's pedestal for an even closer look.\nLeave Lady Liberty behind and ferry across to Ellis Island to discover what 12 million immigrants experienced as they entered the United States for the first time. Step into the Great Hall, and learn about the so-called Stairs of Separation as you walk down the steps where the fates of so many families changed course. Spend as much time as you like exploring the exhibits, or ferry right back to Battery Park to grab lunch at your leisure before the afternoon portion of your tour.\nReconvene at St. Paul's Chapel, where New Yorkers gathered on September 11, 2001 to await news of loved ones and where volunteer workers rested in the weeks following the attacks. Pass by the Winter Garden and the Eleven Tears Memorial before making your way to the 9/11 Memorial itself.\nGaze down into the deep reflecting pools, where water cascades peacefully in the footprints left by the fallen Twin Towers. Your guide leads you to poignant tributes like the Fireman's Memorial before leaving you to walk through the stirring 9/11 Memorial Museum on your own.",

      "descriptionLong": "The Book of Mormon has taken the theater world by storm, offering a show that’s irreverently sweet and incredibly smart. Laugh out loud as this award-winning Broadway hit comes to life, combining religious satire with expert choreography and hilarious songs.\nWatch the story unfold as 2 Mormon missionaries arrive in a Ugandan village with completely unrealistic expectations. One missionary, Elder Price, is an enthusiastic go-getter with a strong dedication to his faith, while his partner, Elder Cunningham, is a socially awkward but well meaning nerd whose tendency to embroider the truth soon lands him in trouble. A heavy dose of culture shock and a fair amount of comical naiveté create unexpected and uproarious situations that only the creators of South Park could have dreamed up.\nEnjoy the Grammy-winning soundtrack as the protagonists bumble through their Latter Day responsibilities, eager to share the Book of Mormon—a text that only one of them has read—with villagers more concerned by the violent whims of a manic local warlord. Songs like Turn It Off and Spooky Mormon Hell Dream offer hilarious insight into the missionaries' own inner turmoil. Follow every awkward moment, religious jab, and carefully crafted pun as the play draws toward a climactic ending you have to see for yourself.",

      "descriptionLong": "Fall under the spell of this classic yet haunting love story as you journey deep beneath the stage of the Paris Opera House with the Phantom and his beloved soprano—Christine. Winner of 7 Tony Awards® including Best Musical, The Phantom of the Opera is Broadway's longest-running show.\nAt the Paris Opera House, a hideously deformed and masked Phantom lurks beneath the stage. He exercises a reign of terror over the performers at the opera in his quest to turn Christine, the young soprano he loves, into a star. Elaborately costumed actors are illuminated and transport you into a world of intrigue and high drama from the moment the curtain comes up.\nPowerful music, stirring vocals, and poetic lyrics move the action along as the Phantom and Christine glide in a boat across a candlelit stage en route to his underground lair. Songs like the achingly beautiful &quot;Think of Me,” the tender “The Music of the Night,” and the powerful titular number “The Phantom of the Opera” are sure to stir your emotions and keep you on the edge of your seat.\nWith fantastic stage effects, a heartbreaking story line, and the timeless songs of Andrew Lloyd Webber, it's no wonder Phantom has captivated the hearts of millions for more than 25 years.",
