Rio de Janeiro
This has got to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. With their mountain backdrops, Copacabana and Ipanema beaches are world famous, and an apartment on one of these beachfronts can cost millions. Elsewhere in the city, many people – about a fifth – live in shanty towns known here as favelas. It is hard to live in a favela yet people do look out for each other. There are now more projects to improve favela life - building schools and community centres and providing courses in computer training - but many residents are quite cynical about the city authorities, especially as the cost of living is so high these days. Not long ago, half a million people voted for a monkey to become mayor of the city to show their disapproval. Some of the city’s former favela dwellers are now world famous – Ronaldo was one of many footballers to kick his way out of a favela. Crime seems to be getting worse by the day, most of it connected to rival drug gangs selling cocaine or crack. When Michael Jackson made the video for “They don’t care about us” in one of the favelas his people had to negotiate with the local drug lords. Battles between the police and the drug gangs have got worse and worse. I read recently that more police officers have been killed this year than American armed forces in Iraq. Thanks to the bay, sea breezes help to blow away a lot of the pollution despite the number of crowded freeways across the city. There is a subway train system too which makes it easier to get to downtown parts of the city. With ancestors from Europe, Africa and other parts of South America, this city has a very rich cultural mix. It comes alive at Carnival time in February with every favela putting together its own music and dance troupe – yes, it’s definitely a fine city for partying!
