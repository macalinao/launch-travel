Warsaw
The thing that is most likely to strike newcomers is the city’s mixture of architecture. Different eras blend together - communist tower blocks stand next to 21stcentury skyscrapers of which New Yorkers would be jealous. But many stand empty as the economic depression put many companies out of business, and the country’s laws discouraged foreigners from investing here.  In the industrial area of Wola in the west, the huge factories making heavy machinery, automobiles, and consumer electronics are almost all gone too. Some have been turned into service facilities, like banks, or rare entertainment spots (underground clubs and bikers bars). Most people are now employed in the service sector, like in the huge hypermarkets and shopping malls that have appeared all over the city, especially on the outskirts. The most attractive part of the city is Starówka, the old city, now a UN-protected heritage site. The rebuilding work here is outstanding, as they used pre-war photos and 18th century paintings to restore it to its original splendour. Many people live in tower blocks around the city centre, which are much like inner city areas elsewhere. These places, like Ursynów and Grochów, are rundown and dirty. Some are the battleground of youth gangs known as “Blockers”. Others are covered with racist graffiti. Meanwhile, richer inhabitants live in small, one family houses, or secure neighbourhoods surrounded by walls in districts like Mokotów, but this is only the privileged few. Public transport reflects the lack of money put into the city. I have no car and suffer almost everyday in buses, trams and the tube!  Roads are frequently full of holes and during heavy rain, our inefficient drainage system can cause floods in the streets. When you go in a bus or a car during a storm it’s like being in a motorboat!  But the buses and trams go almost everywhere within the city, so you can get where you want easily.  There are plenty of cheap taxis too.
