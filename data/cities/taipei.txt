Taipei
The city that I live in today is much better than it was ten years ago. The economy may not be so healthy, but this is such a modern city. New technology is everywhere – many of the new models of mobile phones and computers are made here and we get them first! It’s very international with a 7-Eleven or Starbucks on every street, and we have many other foreign banks, restaurants, bookstores, even schools in the city. Karaoke bars are everywhere too. It’s cleaner than it used to be – streets seem to be swept more often, and our new highways and mass transit rail system have helped a bit with the traffic. We’ve still got traffic problems though, and pollution can be bad, especially from the millions of motorbikes and scooters on the streets. As the city lies in a bowl surrounded by mountains, the pollution sits on top of us on some days like a blanket. A great way to escape the city and get some clean air is to walk a few blocks after the World Trade Center on Hsinyi road and head up into the mountains. It is beautiful up there. In September 1999, everyone in the city woke up to a rumbling roar from a 7.3 earthquake, the worst for a hundred years. Thousands of buildings collapsed and more than a thousand people died. We get bad floods sometimes as well. A couple of years ago, the whole city was underwater. Thousands of cars were left abandoned and floating along streets. Basements were completely flooded too, and I heard that about 80% of people didn’t have insurance for natural disasters. In such a modern city, there are always things to do, things to buy, bills to pay, etc but not always enough money to earn. Competition for jobs can be intense, and I am thinking of moving to China where I can earn more money and have a better standard of living. Some of my friends have already moved, and I won’t have problems with the language either.
