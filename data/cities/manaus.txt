Manaus
The city is named after an Indian tribe and means, “the daughter of the Gods”. It used to be one of the world’s most important cities as people got rich from rainforest rubber. Today, modern industries concentrate here, with many foreign companies like Yamaha, Sony, Philips and Samsung taking advantage of the low tax rates. Many people are only paid the minimum wage of $60 a month and have to do other things to survive. More people are now working in tourism and if you can afford it, there are new university courses to learn about working in the tourism sector. For tourists, there are the attractions of the rainforest, and trips down the Amazon and its many tributaries. And there are projects to make the city more beautiful, comfortable and safe for our visitors. The crime rate is not too bad, but in the last three years there have been more violent crimes that I usually hear about elsewhere – not here. The police are very corrupt and cannot be trusted; if you have money, they treat you like a citizen. If you don’t, they treat you like a bandit. Another problem for us is malaria. Sometimes, six thousand new cases are reported in a month. The worst spread of malaria is in new housing areas where mosquitoes breed in pools of water. To get around the city, 80% of people use public transport. There are now big buses called Expressos. They are air-conditioned which is essential, especially in the summer when it is very humid and the temperature reaches the high 30s. But there are many more small cars on the road and the city is not prepared for this! As good Brazilians, we are passionate about soccer here. We have five soccer teams in the second division but only one big stadium. When the national team plays here, the city has a holiday, and everyone is free to go to the stadium to support the seleção brasileira. Dancing is big too, and in the last two years a kind of music known as forro has been the new fever.
