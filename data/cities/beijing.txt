Beijing
This ancient city is changing very fast. It’s currently one big ‘let’s get ready for the Olympics’ building site - old blocks of Stalinist-style flats and traditional courtyards are being pulled down and replaced by dazzling, new high-rise apartment blocks and shopping malls, much like Hong Kong. Apparently, there are more cranes per square kilometre here than anywhere else in the world! Of course, pockets of the old city still exist in the lanes behind the Forbidden City. Other parts have escaped the developers so far. This city used to be famous as a sea of bicycles – five or six lanes deep at rush hour. Now cars are taking over and this is adding to already choking levels of pollution. Blue sky days here are something to be excited about. Ten years ago, clothing was still pretty drab – blues and greys – and it was amazing to have a phone in your home. Now young people are armed with WAP phones and dress like MTV VJs just like anywhere else. Football is big here too. Recently, I saw David Beckham play at the Workers Stadium, his first in the Real Madrid strip. Talk about hysteria!
