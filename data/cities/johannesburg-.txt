Johannesburg 
Despite the huge political changes in our country, we still live in the same house, in the same suburb, behind the same high walls and gates, with a burglar alarm and armed response guards.  We are continually reminded of the crime rate through television, radio and the press. Although only three million people live here, there are more than five thousand murders a year and at least twice as many rapes. Police admit that they do not control large areas of the city. We try to ignore it – after all, it’s been like this for a long time. The city suffers from high rates of air pollution from vehicle exhaust, open fires and coal-burning for cooking and heating. The city’s two rivers are also considered unsafe, primarily because of untreated human waste and chemicals leaching from piles of mining dross. Mining has also contaminated much of the soil in the vicinity. The AIDS epidemic has made things worse for many people. Nationally, it is feared that the number of infected people may be as high as 20 percent of the population. During our normal daily lives we don’t travel any great distances.  It’s a long time since we went into the centre of the city. Shopping malls are everywhere so everything we need is “on our doorstep”.  Most major businesses have moved to the suburbs and buildings which used to house them in the Central Business District are now occupied by people just wanting a roof over their heads.  Accommodation has always been at a premium here as, despite our problems, many flock to our city from the rest of the continent and the rest of the world, coming to look for work, and staying to enjoy the lively cosmopolitan atmosphere and the wonderful year-round sunny climate.
