Tokyo
This city has changed a lot in the last few years. The boom times are definitely over. It’s much harder to hold onto a job and sometimes you see unemployed businessmen living with their shame in cardboard cities under bridges. It doesn’t feel safe anymore either. Crime is on the rise, especially between gangs, and it’s more polluted too – a haze hangs over the city cutting out the sunlight, especially on hot and humid days in the summer. With the economy in trouble, house prices are falling which is a good thing. I used to live in an apartment that felt more like a box, but now I have found a place on the waterfront of the bay. I even have friends who live in new high-rise apartments right in the centre. The city is so big that it is more like having lots of cities within a city. I still make new discoveries every time I go out – it’s hard to get bored here. There are open spaces thanks to the hundreds of tiny parks across the city – they are good places to escape the fast pace of life here, and they are also places to run to if there’s an earthquake. Apparently, the city’s plan to cope with earthquakes is the best in the world. No-one wants a repeat of the disaster of the Great Kanto earthquake in 1923. No matter where you live, it doesn’t take long to get to the city centre. If you live out in Nagano for instance, you can take the Shinkansen bullet train that is dead quick. It’s a great city for food too. There are still many traditional sushi places where you can sit down at a counter and order the sushi you want to eat. Although it’s not westernized (yet!) fast food places are appearing as well.
