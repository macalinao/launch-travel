Banjul
My home city must be one of the smallest capitals in the world. It was built on a small island so there is no room for it to grow. There is just one road across the mangrove swamps connecting the city with the rest of the country. A much bigger town has developed on the mainland about 7 kilometres away. There are no tall office buildings or blocks of flats in my city. The tallest building is an arch built to commemorate a military coup in 1995. The best views of the city can be got from the top of the arch. From here you can see the mosque, the hospital and the docks where we export peanuts and import things like fabric, rice and cars. In the last ten years the sea has posed a big problem and we have had to get advice from the Dutch to prevent erosion. Large blocks of concrete have been put all along the ocean side of the island to protect the coastline. There are not many jobs at the moment and prices are going up really quickly but just about everyone has a mobile phone. There are a lot more cars and we now know about traffic jams but in the whole country we still only have one set of traffic lights. Me and my friends like to hang out brewing attaya, a strong sweet tea. We all support British football teams and we can talk about football for hours and hours. Now and then we go to the movies. Most of the foreigners around here are tourists who stay in the hotels about 15 kilometres away. They come here for the sea, sun and what we call the ‘Smiling Coast’. One of my friends has a taxi and takes tourists round the country. Another runs an internet café. Life isn’t always easy but I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.
