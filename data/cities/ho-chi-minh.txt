Ho Chi Minh
At six in the morning you don’t need an alarm clock to wake up - you won’t sleep through the steady stream of motorbikes and their horns - six million of them! Meanwhile, bicycles are disappearing from the scene and cars are taking over as kings of the road. Traffic is not the only thing that has changed a lot. Since the USA lifted its trade embargo on the country ten years ago, neon signs advertising companies like Pepsi and Nike are everywhere. Many people now work in factories making clothes and shoes for these global companies. The war with America may be history now, but it is not forgotten. People crippled and scarred by napalm beg in the streets while others sell fake GI lighters to tourists. At 7 am, people of all backgrounds are on the streets, enjoying delicious one-dollar beef noodle soup or French baguettes and coffee on low plastic chairs. They shout one-syllable words in their mobiles or watch girls walking to school in their elegant white long dresses with a high split over wide trousers. How can they keep their dresses so white with all the fumes polluting the air? In the evening during the dry season, people gather on the pavement to have their rice dinners, to play checkers, to sell hammocks to tourists or to beg with their cone hats. When it rains, it pours, especially from May to November and then people rush home as fast as they can.
