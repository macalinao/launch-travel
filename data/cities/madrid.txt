Madrid
People in this city are quite friendly compared to people elsewhere, but within the country we are seen as a bit cold and old-fashioned, and the cost of living is much higher too. Although it is still quite a traditional city, it has changed quite a lot. Everyone has a mobile phone these days, and more people from overseas have come to live here. Recently this city has become well known for the ‘purchase’ of a well-known English football player by the city’s top football team. Recently, he was voted one of the most famous people in the country! For me, the nightlife here is one of the best! During the summer, people of all ages gather around bars and go out to clubs. Walking along the streets at night you get invaded by promotions for free drinks. At this time of year it gets really hot as the city is located right in the centre of the country. This also means that the winters are pretty cold. As in the rest of the country, people eat quite a bit later than most places, and as we love eating we spend much more time sitting at the table and enjoying our food and wine. It is very popular to eat ‘tapas’, a set of small, traditional dishes. Getting around the city is easy as the public transport system has improved enormously in the last decade. Metro trains run regularly and there are lots of modern buses. But when it is very warm it’s terrible travelling by bus. Crime rates are not excessively higher than other cities in Europe, although some people might disagree with me. In fact, I think it’s a great city to live in!
