Cairo
My city, the largest on the continent, is a great place for night owls and those interested in culture, especially historians. It has many different sections, with an old medieval part which includes a large castle, a nineteenth century CBD, former colonial areas and modern satellite towns. There are lots of restaurants, clubs and discos. You can go horse riding, play tennis at the many tourist hotels or go to a concert at the Opera House. In the last few years many international fast food outlets have appeared, which will deliver to your home. Supermarkets are also quite a new way of shopping here and just recently a hypermarket opened on the outskirts of the city. There are far more consumer goods available now than there were a few years ago, but only some people can afford them – the gap between rich and poor here is big. This city is home to a good many foreigners who find the local people are very friendly and welcoming. It is quite safe to be out on your own. The crime rate is low but the traffic can be pretty scary – you need courage and agility to cross roads here! The new metro and bridges over the river are supposed to have reduced the traffic jams but air pollution is still a major problem. It is also a very noisy place to live, as this city never sleeps!
