Mexico City
To start with it's probably the most populated city on the planet. We are a population of 22 million but many people are not recorded. As you might imagine with such a huge population it is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The high altitude makes the air thinner, and the pollution from cars and factories gets trapped and concentrated in the valley. If you don’t know what it’s like to smoke 60 a day, come and visit! The air is so dirty that when children paint a picture of the sky they often paint it grey. Breathing problems, headaches, coughs and eye infections are common, and thousands die from the pollution every year. Crime is getting out of control too. Car-jacking and taxi-jacking is so common now that visitors are warned not to use the cabs! The police department has more officers than the Canadian army but there is still not enough. Many of them are corrupt anyway. Another problem is thanks to the Spanish. When they ruled the country, they thought (not very wisely) that Lake Texcoco should be turned into land. This is now part of the eastern outskirts of the city and it is sinking. It is also the place that shook the most during our worst earthquake in 1985. The city is changing fast – new buildings are going up everywhere. But the cost of living is very high; I read somewhere that the cost of living is about the same as Geneva but without the social benefits or infrastructure. There is a huge gap between rich and poor too. Many people have terrible living conditions and for the poor, it is a struggle to survive in this chaotic place. You can have a lot of fun though. The nightlife is amazing and people know how to enjoy themselves, no matter what their income bracket. It's the only way to cope with all the stress! The art scene is incredibly rich and with a wide and interesting mix of artists. It may not be London or New York, but compared to most Latin American cities it is very multicultural.
