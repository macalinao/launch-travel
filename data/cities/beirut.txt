Beirut
I live in a city that 13 years ago was one of the biggest disaster areas in the world.  Back then, finding a building which was not peppered with bullet holes would have been as rare as winning the lottery. Today I am happy to say the city has been rebuilt and much of its pre-war glory has returned. Once again, we can call it, “the Paris of the Middle East”! The city is one of the oldest in the world and since the beginning of its existence it has been a melting pot for different religions, cultures and races.  With only a population of four million people there are 17 different religions living together and sharing the same land.  The fact that the city is situated on the shores of the Mediterranean, and is close to Africa, Asia, and Europe has a lot to do with it. It is pretty expensive to live here, and there is a large gap between rich and poor. Although food is quite cheap electricity and phone bills are amongst the highest in the world.  This city was also ranked in the top three in the world for the number of cars (and mobile phones!) per person so it’s no surprise that there is a lot of traffic on the streets. Air pollution may be improving with the ban on diesel engines, but it’s still quite bad. This city is well known for its nightlife and restaurants and caters for all age groups. The younger crowd hang out in bars and clubs while the older people tend to prefer lounges and restaurants. My city is now a big destination for tourists as it has mountain ranges and beaches all within twenty minutes of each other.  During the winter people come to ski on the snow-covered mountains and during the summer they can enjoy our beaches. The crime rate is relatively low, but the political situation can be tense because of troubles elsewhere in the region. None of us wants a return to those war-torn years.
