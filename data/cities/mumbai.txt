Mumbai
This city never stands still – it’s busy 24 hours a day. The city covers a longish rectangular island connected to the mainland by several bridges, and it overlooks a wide bay. About 12 million people live here, and it’s growing all the time. Here, the law of the jungle prevails: ‘survival of the fittest’. Half the inhabitants live in slums, clinging to dreams of making it big in the city. Becoming a movie star is a dream shared by many as this is home to the world’s most creative film industry. In one area next to a railway track 32, 000 households have set up home. From time to time, the city authorities clear these slums and people have to find somewhere else to live. Some live in the huge water and sewage pipes left over from building projects; others build flimsy dwellings on the city’s pavements. Meanwhile, there are other inhabitants who are very, very rich. They need to be – rents in the luxurious suburbs are some of the highest in the world. It is one of the top five financial capitals of the world and it’s a very cosmopolitan place too – a mosaic of cultures and communities lead separate lives side-by-side in this city. As the city gets bigger and bigger, the traffic gets worse and worse. Stress from driving in the city has driven many commuters to breaking point. ‘Road rage’ is becoming more common, and the number of accidents is on the rise too. Meanwhile, the suburban rail network has more than two billion passengers a year, and you need guts to travel on a bus through the city during rush-hour – there are no doors and passengers are literally spilling out – you need good ‘flying skills’ to hold onto whatever you can! Pollution can be extreme because of all the vehicles on the city’s roads, and toxic chemicals churned out by factories in the new part of the city.
