Sydney
Built around the shores of the world’s largest natural harbour, my city is a mix & match of architectural styles and cultural influences, both Asian and European. Because of the building boom of the ‘70s, large corporate skyscrapers line the backdrop of white sandy beaches and coves. With few old buildings, it definitely gives the impression of a new, modern city. In the last ten years or so more cultures have arrived, many from Asia which gives us a great deal of quality food and Asian high street fashion along with a feeling that we are now more like America than Europe. The bicentennial celebrations in 1988 and the massive harbour redevelopment project boosted the city's standing in the country and the world. Vast amounts of money also poured into city after we won the bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games. It’s a special place now! Though unemployment is still high so too is the quality of life. There are hundreds of restaurants and bars where you can eat and drink cheaply all through the night. Our transport system of rail, bus or ferry generally runs on time so it's easy to spend nights drinking in one of the many hotels that seem to be on every street corner. Weekend recovery is generally spent on one of the city's beaches, either soaking up the sun, having barbecues with friends, or surfing the great Pacific waves. Being right on the coast means that generally the air quality is good apart from when bush fire smoke hangs over the city in the summer sometimes. Even on cool winter days, it’s still warm enough to visit the beach or play sport. Most people are big fans of rugby and cricket, and a trip to the football stadium to watch the Swans is a favourite past time.
